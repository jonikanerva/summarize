Start by generating a good title for the article stating what the text is about objectively, followed by the byline who is the author(s) of the article and date written (Author: X, Date: Y)

Then create a bulleted list of the objective facts and key points, followed by a bulleted list of the authorâ€™s opinions. Each bullet must express exactly one idea, with no other bullet having the same topic. Ensure that the most important points are at the top.

Then write an assessment of whether the article provides sources for its facts, comment on the reliability of those sources, and/or the reputation of the author.

Conclude with a one-paragraph summary of the whole article.

Here is the article content:
